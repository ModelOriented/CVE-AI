You can simply submit your own report with AI model vulnerabilities. 

This can be done in three steps.

1. Make a fork of the repository [https://github.com/ModelOriented/CVE-AI](https://github.com/ModelOriented/CVE-AI)
2. In the `_publications` directory you will find markdown files with report descriptions and in the `files` directory you will find the reports (currently they are mainly pdf files). Add your report here
3. Submit the report via pull-request to the `ModelOriented/CVE-AI` repository

Make sure the report has explicit information about (1) what model is being analyzed, (2) what adversarial analysis techniques are being used, (3) and what the results of that analysis are.
