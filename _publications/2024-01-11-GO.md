excerpt: 'This report identifies shortcomings of using convolutional architectures as Go policy networks by comparing them to Transformer policies. The findings show that while convolutional networks excel at capturing local features, they struggle with global phenomena, which can be detrimental in games like Go. Transformers, with their flexible attention mechanisms, better incorporate both local and global understanding, suggesting potential for future research in using Transformers for large positional games.'

In this report we aim to spot shortcomings of using a convolutional architecture as a Go policy network. By comparing it to an equivalently trained Transformer policy and employing XAI methods such as Ceteris Paribus, we can see where each network under and overperforms. This work points in the direction of further research of Transformer architectures in positional games such as Go, where previously it was believed Convolutions were SoTA.

Our experiments show the limitations of convolutional policy networks. They are great at capturing local features, however limited in attending to global phenomena. In some tasks, like the game of Go, this might be detrimental. Transformers on the other hand are able to seamlessly incorporate both the local and global understanding via its flexible attention mechanism. This points in the direction of future work on implementing Transformers as policy networks for large positional games.
